            <p>Imposter syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Wikipedia</a></em></p>

<p>Many successful, ambitious people feel like this; afraid they don't belong with their peers. At times, I've experienced this myself. Presenting in a room full of brilliant engineers and product experts, all silently listening to what I have to say; and suddenly feel like I'm not qualified enough to say anything of value.</p>

<p>I've also started noticing when others experience imposter syndrome. </p>

<p>What I've realized is, that when I see this happening to someonelse, my reaction can quickly turn someone who is nervous and unsure of themself into a confident speaker. Simply by how I respond and engage with them. </p>

<p>Take for example your word choice. I often catch myself midsentence, having said "<strong>obviously</strong>" and instantly feeling like I've insulted the person I'm talking to. Which of course isn't what I'm trying to do. </p>

<p>Just think about the word obviously.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>obviously</strong> - in a way that is easily perceived or understood; clearly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It undermines the intelligence of the person you're talking to, and can reinforce those who have imposter syndrome. </p>

<p>Because of this I've begun trying to say <strong>of course</strong> instead. Along with many other word substitutions. </p>

<p>At the same time, I've also began realizing that just because someone says something in a way that makes me feel like an idiot for not knowing, doesn't necessarily mean they think I'm an idiot.</p>

<p>They might very well think I'm an idiot; but I'd like to think they're also beating themselves up mid-sentence for having said <strong>obviously</strong> instead of <strong>of course</strong>.</p>
